# Object-Detection-System


Introduction
Motion detection using Python is easy because of the multiple open-source libraries provided by the Python programming language which detect even slight motion in the frame and highlight it with green rectangle frame and the time the object entered and the time, it exited the frame is recorded and using bokeh library of python and python compatibility with other languages make it possible for to plot with html. For example, it can be used for invigilation in online exams or for security purposes in stores, banks, etc.
